What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	When you initialize a repository, it allows the directory to push commits. This allows the user to be able to start using git and keep track of their files.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area is the area where you decide what to commit into the repository. It is inbetween the working directory and repository. It allows you the user to commit a certain file instead of all files at once if the user wishes.
