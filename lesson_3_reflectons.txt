When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  When you are working on it with a group so that others can push new files into the repository. Also when you are working on it from 2 different computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	This may be because other people are sending files into the remote repository, where you may pull and introduce a new bug into the program and have it fail.
